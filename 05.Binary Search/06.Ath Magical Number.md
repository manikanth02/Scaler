// Approach::

// Understanding Magical Numbers:

// A number is called magical if it is divisible by either B or C.
// You need to find the A-th smallest magical number.
// Using Binary Search:

// Perform a binary search on the range of possible values of the magical number.
// Minimum possible magical number is min(B, C), and the maximum possible number is A * min(B, C).

// count = mid/B + mid/C - mid/lcm(B,C);

// This formula works because:
// mid/B → Counts numbers divisible by B
// mid/C → Counts numbers divisible by C
// mid/lcm(B, C) → Adjusts for double-counting numbers divisible by both B and C





int mod = 1e9 + 7;
int Solution::solve(int A, int B, int C) {

// :: STEP:1
// Calculate lcm;
// long long gcd = __gcd(B,C);
long long lcm = ((1LL*B*C))/__gcd(B,C);

long long left = 1;
// HERE I HAVE DONE MISTAKE,MISTAKE MEANS I AM DOING
// right = A*min(B,C) but it should be 1LL*A*min(B,C) ?

long long right = (1LL*A*min(B,C));
long long ans = min(B,C);

while(left <= right){
    long long mid = left + (right - left)/2;
    long long num = mid/B + mid/C - mid/lcm;

    if(num == A){
        ans = (mid)%mod;
        right = mid - 1;
    }else if(num < A){
        left = mid + 1;
    }else{
        right = mid -1;
    }
}
return (int)ans;
}
