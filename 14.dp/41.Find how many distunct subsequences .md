âœ… Problem: Distinct Subsequences That Move on a Number Line 
  *Was posted on Leetcode but deleted later.
Problem Description
You are given a 1D number line with positions labeled from 0 to n and a string s representing a sequence of move instructions. Each character in the string s is either:
'r': move one step to the right (i.e., from position p to p + 1)
'l': move one step to the left (i.e., from position p to p - 1)
You start at position x on the number line and want to reach position y.
You can pick any subsequence of the string s. A subsequence is formed by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
You need to find how many distinct subsequences (that follow valid movements and do not move off the number line) take you from position x to position y.
Return the result modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.
