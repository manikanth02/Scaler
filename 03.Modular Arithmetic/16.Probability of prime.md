Step 1: Understanding the Sample Space
When two dice are rolled, each die has 6 faces (numbered 1 to 6), so the total number of possible outcomes is:

6
×
6
=
36
6×6=36
Each outcome represents a pair (x, y) where:

𝑥
x is the number on the first die
𝑦
y is the number on the second die
Step 2: Listing the Possible Sums
The possible sums when rolling two dice range from:

1
+
1
=
2
(minimum sum)
1+1=2(minimum sum)
6
+
6
=
12
(maximum sum)
6+6=12(maximum sum)
The possible sums are:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Step 3: Identifying Prime Sums
A prime number is a number that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.

From our list of sums, the prime numbers are:

2
,
3
,
5
,
7
,
11
2,3,5,7,11
Step 4: Counting Favorable Outcomes
Now, let's count how many ways we can get each of these prime sums:

Prime Sum	Favorable Pairs 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y)	Count
2	(1,1)	1
3	(1,2), (2,1)	2
5	(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)	4
7	(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)	6
11	(5,6), (6,5)	2
Total favorable outcomes = 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15.

Step 5: Calculating the Probability
The probability is given by:

Number of favorable outcomes
Total number of outcomes
Total number of outcomes
Number of favorable outcomes

=
15
36
= 
36

​
 
=

12
= 
12
5
​
 
So, the probability that the sum of two dice will be a prime number is 
5
12
12
5
​
  or approximately 0.4167 (41.67%).

Final Answer:
5
