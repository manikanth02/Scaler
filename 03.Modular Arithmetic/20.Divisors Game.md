// idea - 1 ::

// Traverse  from 1 to A and check if it is divisble by both B and C and store all such no in special integer
// and return count.
// T.C = O(10^9)


// idea -> 2 ::
// Minimum integer that is divisible by both B and C is LCM of B and C. and all multiple of LCM(B,C) are sepcial numbers
//
